/**
 * This mapper is part of the document frequency computation.
 * <p>
 * The document frequency of a term is the number of documents it occurs in. If a document contains
 * a term three times, it is counted only once for this document. But if another document contains
 * the word as well, the overall frequency is two.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Document 1: "Big Big Big Data"
 * Document 2: "Hello Big Data"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The document frequency of "Big" is 2, because it appears in two documents (even though it appears
 * four times in total). "Hello" has a document frequency of 1, because it only appears in document
 * 2.
 * <p>
 * The map method will be called independently for each document.
