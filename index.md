# Welcome to BigDataClass.org!

We have set up this website to give people a better understanding of the field of Big Data! We are a group of developers from the Stratosphere analytics system, now renamed to [Flink](http://flink.incubator.apache.org/)

Before you get started on the exercises please go to
[Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/gettingstarted.html) to learn how to get the
example code and set-up your development environment.

<hr>

Go to [Basics: Word Count]({{ site.baseurl }}/basics_WC.html) to get familiar with the basic syntax.

Go to [Basics: Pi estimation]({{ site.baseurl }}/basics_approxPi.html) to start writing some code. This is a math exercise that applies the Monte Carlo method to estimate Pi.

Go to [Exercise I-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise_1.html) if you are a Java programmer.

Go to [Exercise I-2]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise_2.html) if you are already or want to become a [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) developer (**Recommended!**)

Go to [Exercise II]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise_II_Trig_enum.html) if you would like to explore a graph problem.

## Contact

If you have questions for the assignments, write on our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigdataclass-org) use the comments on each page or [open an issue](https://github.com/stratosphere/bigdataclass.org/issues/new) on GitHub


## Contribute

This Website is just another [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/stratosphere/bigdataclass.org) so you can open a pull request if you want to add something (YouTube videos, new exercise, nicer homepage)
Both the website (see `gh-pages` branch) and the exercise skeletons are on the Repository.
