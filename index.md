# Welcome to BigDataClass.org!

We have set up this website to educate more people in the field of Big Data! We are a group of developers from the [Stratosphere](http://stratosphere.eu/) analytics system.

Before you get started on the exercises please go to
[Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/gettingstarted.html) to learn how to get the
example code and set-up your development environment.

<hr>

Go to [Exercise 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise_1.html) if you are a Java programmer.

Go to [Exercise 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise_2.html) if you are already or want to become a [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) developer (**Recommended!**)


## Contact

If you have questions for the assignments, write on our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigdataclass-org) use the comments on each page or [open an issue](https://github.com/stratosphere/bigdataclass.org/issues/new) on GitHub


## Contribute

This Website is just another [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/stratosphere/bigdataclass.org) so you can open a pull request if you want to add something (YouTube videos, new exercise, nicer homepage)
Both the website (see `gh-pages` branch) and the exercise skeletons are on the Repository.
